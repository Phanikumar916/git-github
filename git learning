GIT  - LOCAL REPOSITORY (CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT TOOL)
GITHUB - REMOTE REPOSITORY

Individual do all the tasks at the end of the day all the tasks will place in one shared location that is GIT

LOCAL REPOSITORY - GIT - what ever job done in your local system will be stored in one place
REMOTE REPOSITORY - GITHUB

First we have to Create One Folder
Then copy all your files into that particular folder

Create one folder (Ex: I have create a folder in c drive called gitlearning)
Go to that folder and Right Click and Select Git Bash here then one window will be opened
Next we need to initilaze the Repository then give command
git init
Then empty git repository will be created in (/c/gitlearning)
Now i need to Intergated Local and Remote Repository
Then Only i can push the Files from Local to Remote repository
Remote Repository is called as origin, then give the below command

*************  git remote add origin "URL"

Next if we need to pull from github give below command

git pull origin main (here i have given main beacuse in git hub i have main repositroy, if it is master give " git pull origin master ")

Now if you go to C-drive folder you can see the readme.md and jenkins file (this is how you can pull from remote repository to local repository)

Create One file in that folder (Ex:test1.txt)  - this file is in the folder but it is not part of the GIT
If we want to add the file to the git we need to give particular commands, we cannot see each and every file created
which is part of GIT or not, so first command you need to give is

********* git status **********

Now it wll show test1.txt to be committed

We cannot add directly to the git repository, in between there is an intermediate layer called " INDEX "

git add  - it will add to index
git commit - it will add index to GIT repository

git add test1.txt (it will added to the index)

git commit -m "this is my first commit" (here comments we need to give , in future if any developers want to check which content i have changed it will help us)

After Committing we can push into GITHUB repository

If i want to commit multiple files into git repository

Create 2 files like test2.txt and test3.txt and modify test1.txt

Now apply git status
it will show Modified - test1.txt & Untracked files test2.txt and test3.txt

GIT CLONE - CREATING LOCAL REPOSITORY BASED ON THE REMOTE REPOSITORY 
GIT PULL - IF ANY CHANGES HAS BEEN DONE IN REMOTE REPOSITORY, THAT ONE WE NEED INTO LOCAL REPOSITROY MEANS WE WILL USE CLONE
GIT PUSH - MOVING LOCAL REPOSITORY TO REMOTE REPOSITORY


git clone " REPO URL FROM GITHUB " - it will create copy of folder in local repository

cd learning

create two files and edit through vifile1 and vifile2

then git status and we need to index first

git add -A or git add .

git commit -a -m "message"

git log or git log --oneline



********** GIT CLONE - WE DONT HAVE LOCAL REPOSITORY, BASED ON THE REMOTE REPOSITORY WE WILL CREATE LOCAL REPOSITORY, WE WILL GET COPY OF REMOTE REPOSITORY INTO LOCAL REPOSITORY

********** GIT PULL - LOCAL REPOSITORY ALREADY AVAILABLE, BUT IN REMOTE REPOSITORY SOME CHANGES HAS BEEN DONE, IF WE WANT TO GET ONLY THOSE CHANGES WE WILL USER PULL COMMAND


NOW I HAVE CHANGED FILE CONTENT IN GITHUB BUT THOSE CHANGES ARE NOT HAPPENED IN LOCAL WORKSPACE THEN WE WILL USE PULL COMMAND

git pull origin main
