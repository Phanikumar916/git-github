 ******** chown username:groupname filename *********
ex: if a file having xyz:xyz (user and group) if we want to change user and group
then chown tom:admin test1 (then if you check in ls -l we will see tom as user and admin as group

 **** ls -l /etc/ ****  you will see all the files wich are owned by user and group

cat /etc/paaswd (when you execute this command it will show
     USERNAME:PASSWORD:UID:GID:GECOS:HOMEDIR:SHELL
EX: (PHANI:X:1000:1000:PHANI,,,:home/phani:/bin/bash

X - MEANS ENCRYPTED PASSWORD AND IT IS STORED IN /etc/shadow file
GID - GROUP ID IT WILL BE STORED IN /etc/group file

when exexuting manually we will use  ( adduser & addgroup)
when executed through scripting we will use (useradd & groupadd)

USER TO ADD GROUP

IF WE WANT TO ADD USER TO A GROUP THEN EXECUTE THE BELOW COMMAND

usermod (modifies or changes the user)

usermod -g devops tom (here devops is the group & tom is the user name)
usermod -g group username (when execute this will make devops primary group of the tom)

IF WE WANT ADD USER TO MULTIPLE GROUPS TYPE BELOW COMMAND

usermod -G "list of the groups" username (G overwrites the whole secondary groups list)
usermod -aG "list of the groups" username (if we want to add secondary group to the existing one)
