IN PREVIOUS PROJECT WE HAVE SEEN CI & CD USING ANSBILE

IN THIS PROJECT WE WILL SEE HOW TO DEPLOY A WAR APPLICATION ON DOCKER CONTAINER THROUGH JENKINS WITHOUT ANSIBLE

Create Ec2 Instace

Install Docker and start service by using commands

yum install docker -y

systemctl start docker.service
systemctl status docker.service

useradd dockeradmin
passwd dockeradmin

usermod -aG docker dockeradmin

go to cd /opt
create docker directory
mkdir docker
cd docker

then execute below command and Write a Dockerfile  under /opt/docker

vi Dockerfile (D - Must be capital)

# Pull base image
From tomcat:8-jre8

# Maintainer
MAINTAINER "siva.3991@gmail.com"

Login into Jenkins Console and add Docker server to Execute commands from Jenkins

Manage Jenkins - Configure System  - Publish over SSH  - Add Docker Server and Credintials


Provide Name: DOCKER HOST (Name given for Ec2 Instance)
Host Name: Private IP address of Docker Host
User Name: dockeradmin (User Created in EC2 Instance)
Then Go to advanced Tab, click on Use password authentication, or use a different key
If you give Password and Click on Test Configuration it will show as failed , because you need to give Password less authientication

vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

systemctl restart sshd.service
systemctl status sshd.service

Then Click on Test Configuration, it will show as sucess.

Then Save

Then Click on New Item - Give Name (Ex: Docker_project-3 ) - Click on Maven Project

Click on Source Code Management - Provide GIT URL

Go to Pre-Steps Tab  - in that Goals and Options will be available 
Give  - clean install package
