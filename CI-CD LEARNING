What is CI/CD
CI/CD is a set of practices that automate the building, testing, and deployment stages of software development. 
Automation reduces delivery timelines and increases reliability across the development life cycle.

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION

With CI, developers commit code changes (whether corrective or innovative) into a shared repository. The updates are always small,
making them easy to track. Each new integration triggers an automatic build-and-test sequence. This process provides quick feedback to
the developer and notifies about any errors.

CI requires the use of a continuous integration server, such as Jenkins or Bamboo. 
The CI server automatically tests code written by different developers.



Continuous Delivery (CD)

On top of CI, continuous delivery also provides an automated release process after the integration and build stages.
A manual trigger controls deployment to production.
