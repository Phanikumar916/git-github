IN PREVIOUS PROJECT WE HAVE SEEN HOW TO SETUP THE JENKINS AND TOMCAT SERVER AND DEPLOYING WAR FILE USING THE JENKINS IT SELF, 
I MEAN BUILD AND DEPLOY

IN THIS ONE BUILD WILL HAPPEN IN JENKINS AND DEPLOY WILL HAPPEN THROUGH THE ANSIBLE, WHY BECAUSE WE CANNOT DO THE DEPLOYMENTS IN
COMPLEX ENVINORMENTS, THATS WHY WE WILL GO THROUGH THE EXTERNAL DEPLOYMENT TOOLS

Create ansible instance, and you have already installed ec2 webserver (tomcat) 
sudo amazon-linux-extras install ansible2 -y
yum install git python python-level python-pip openssl -y
host related configuration files all are stored in /etc
vi /etc/ansible/hosts (all inventrory files wil be stored in this file)
Below this line (Ex 1: Ungrouped hosts, specify before any group headers)
[WEBSERVER]
private ip address
Always give private ip address, in real time in vpc you will give private ip address only
vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg (Configuration Files)
Uncomment Inventory & sudo_user (remove # for both the lines and save)
useradd ansible
passwd ansible (give password and enter and it will show /passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully/).
visudo
then give (ansible ALL=(ALL)   NOPASSWD: ALL) to provide ansible permissions and save
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config (to provide password less authentication)
change password authetication no to yes (line no:63)
Continue from Sl.No-18 to 23 in webserver respectively
when we change in ssh file we need to restart 
systemctl restart sshd.service (restart for BOTH MASTER AND NODES)
systemctl status sshd.service  (STATUS FOR BOTH MASTER AND NODES)
login to su -  ansible (for both master and nodes)
ssh-keygen
key will be generated
ssh-copy-id ansible@localhost (to login in to local host)
ssh ansible@localhost (local host will be connected - private ip)
exit
type the below command in Ansible Instance to connect to webserver
sudo ssh-copy-id ansible@"webserver private ip"
enter password
ssh ansible@"private ip for webserver"
you will be connected to node-1
exit

ansilble all -m ping (it will show as success)
Now from ansible server it was connecting to webserver via SSH

now install "PUBLISH OVER SSH" plugin in jenkins server then only it will be available in POST BUILD ACTIONS

Manage Jenkins - Go to Available Tab - Select Publish Over SSH and click on Install without restart

Then go to Manage Jenkins -  Click on Configuration System -  Go down, at last one "SSH SERVERS" TAB will be available

NAME BOX WILL BE AVAILABLE (PROVIDE NAME WHICH YOU HAVE GIVEN FOR ANSIBLE SERVER)

HOST NAME - (PROVIDE ANSIBLE SERVER PRIVATE IP )

USERNAME - (PROVIDE USERNAME CREATED IN ASNIBLE SERVER)

THEN CLICK ON ADVANCED

THEN TICK THE "Use password authentication, or use a different key"

GIVE ANSIBLE USER PASSWORD AND THEN SAVE

Create a New Item by selecting Maven Project

Copy Git hub Webapp link which we have created pom.xml file

Type clean install package in Goals and options available in build tab

THEN GO TO POST BUILD TABS 

SELECT "Send files or execute commands over SSH"

NAME BY DEFAULT IT WILL COME BEACUSE YOU HAVE PROVIDED IN CONFIGURATION SYSTEMS

IN TRASNFER SET TYPE SOURCE FILE "**/*.war"

********** WHEN YOU GIVE **/*war it will take war file from jenkins ec2-instance (already in jenkins war file will be available) *******

/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/hello-world/webapp/target

THEN SAVE AND CLICK ON BUILD

ONE YOU BUILD THEN , THEN *******"WEBAPP DIRECTORY WILL BE CREATED IN ANSIBLE SERVER IN WEBAPP DIRECTORY, WEBAPP.WAR FILE WILL 
BE AVAILABLE*******" THIS WEBAPP DIRECTORY WILL BE CREATED FROM JENKINS SERVER*********************

THEN THIS WAR FILE NEED TO BE EXECUTED IN TOMCAT SERVER (I.E WEBSERVER)

SO WRITE A PLAYBOOK IN ANSIBLE SERVER BY CREATING task.yml file

---
- hosts: WEBSERVER
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: copy war on to tomcat server
      copy:
        src: /home/ansible/webapp/target/webapp.war (path of war file)
        dest: /opt/apache-tomcat-8.5.81/webapps (to which directory war file has to be created)
        
 
 IN Exec command available in transfer set execute ansible playbook by using
 ******* "ansible-playbook (then provide task.yml file path like ex: /opt/playbooks/task.yml) then the exec command will be
 ansible-playbook /opt/playbooks/task.yml) 
 
 THEN SAVE
 
 THEN CLICK ON BUILD
 
 ONCE YOU BUILD IT WILL CREATE ********* ("WEBAPP DIRECTORY CREATED IN ANSIBLE SERVER IN WEBAPP WEBAPP.WAR FILE
 WILL BE AVAILABLE ************)FILE IN ANSIBLE SEVER AND AND THIS WAR FILE WILL BE COPIED IN TOMCAT SERVER
 
 THIS IS HOW WE CAN USE CI/CD USING ANSIBLE
 
 **************ANSIBLE WE CAN USE DEPLOYMENT TOOL ALSO NOT ONLY CONFIGURATION***********
