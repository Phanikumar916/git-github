THE OUTPUT OF PREVIOUS COMMAND AS AN INPUT TO THE NEXT COMMAND IS CALLED PIPING

less - DISPLAYS THE CONTENTS OF A FILE OR A COMMAND OUTPUT, ONE PAGE AT A TIME
less command allows you to navigate  forward or backward through the file
type " : " and enter "SPACE TAB" we will go through the next page & type " b " you will go to previous page
when you reach the end  type " q " it will quit the programme

GREP
Stands for:  Globally search for regular expression and Printout
Searches for a particular pattern of Characters and Displays all lines that contain that pattern
ex: history | grep sudo (all sudo commands which we have provided will appear)
Grep Command is used for finding the Certain Programme or file or directory

REDIRECTS
" > " is the redirector operator
Takes the output from the previous command and sends it to a file that you give

ex: cat file1 > file2

file1 content will be copied into file2 and overwrite the existing content in file2
If we want to add a new Content without overwriting the existing content we need to give the following command

cat file1 >> file2 (" >> "  - append text to the end of the file)
then ctrl+d (save button)
