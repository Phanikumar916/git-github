Container is a Running Envinorment of a Image

Process for building image
• Start with base image
• Load software desired
• Commit base image+software to form new image
• New image can then be base for more software
Image is what is transferred

Create Linux Ec2 Instance

yum install docker -y

docker --version

Now docker is in Running condition, and container also should be run for that give below command so that docker engine will be enabled
and docker deamon and host will be activated

systemctl start docker.service
systemctl status docker.service

docker info (provide complete informantion about root directory, registry, architecture e.t.c)

docker search ubuntu (ex: docker will search ubuntu list available)
docker search nginx (ex: docker will search nginx list available)

docker pull "image name" - to download the image from dockerhub to local"
(ex: docker pull ubuntu - ubuntu will be installed)

If we give only pull it will only only download images from dockerhub to local
So for downloading and creating the container we will use

*********  docker run "image name" ***********

while giving docker run it will download the image and create the container (note that it will create container only but it will not start)

docker ps (to check the running containers)

docker ps -a (to check the start or stopped container)

for starting the container

docker start "container name" - (to start container)

docker run -it --name "container name you want to provide" ubuntu (for which image) /bin/bash

(ex: docker run -it --name phani ubuntu /bin/bash
