Container is a Running Envinorment of a Image

Process for building image
• Start with base image
• Load software desired
• Commit base image+software to form new image
• New image can then be base for more software
Image is what is transferred

Create Linux Ec2 Instance

yum install docker -y

docker --version

Now docker is in Running condition, and container also should be run for that give below command so that docker engine will be enabled
and docker deamon and host will be activated

systemctl start docker.service
systemctl status docker.service

docker info (provide complete informantion about root directory, registry, architecture e.t.c)

docker search ubuntu (ex: docker will search ubuntu list available)
docker search nginx (ex: docker will search nginx list available)

docker pull "image name" - to download the image from dockerhub to local"
(ex: docker pull ubuntu - ubuntu will be installed)

If we give only pull it will only only download images from dockerhub to local
So for downloading and creating the container we will use

*********  docker run "image name" ***********

while giving docker run it will download the image and create the container (note that it will create container only but it will not start)

docker ps (to check the running containers)

docker ps -a (to check the start or stopped container)

for starting the container

docker start "container name" - (to start container)

docker run -it --name "container name you want to provide" ubuntu (for which image) /bin/bash

(ex: docker run -it --name phani ubuntu /bin/bash) - it will create a new container with name phani and with image ubuntu

when you execute above command it will create the container and it will go into that container

if we want go into a particular container give below command

docker attach "container name"

then cat /etc/os-release - to see all details inside container

exit - (to exit the container)

docker stop "container name" - to stop the container

docker rm "container name" - to remove the container


******************************** BUILDING IMAGE FROM CONTAINER *******************************


(*******Now login into container which has an image ubuntu then*********)
apt update -y
then install git & tree
apt install git -y
apt install tree -y

Then exit and come to root directory
then type the below command

docker diff "container name" - (List the changed files and directories in a container᾿s filesystem since the container was created)

then from image to container by using following command

********* docker commit "EXISTING CONTAINER ID WHICH YOU INSTALLED GIT AND TREE" "NEW IMAGE NAME"

(EX: docker commit container id coromandel) - that means coromandel image will be created
from image to container - docker run -it --name "new container name" coromandel /bin/bash
then go to that container - docker attach "container id"
there you can see already installed git and tree and one file has been created


BASE IMAGE -> CONTAINER CREATION -> ADDING APPLICATIONS LIKE GIT & TREE -> CREATING IMAGE FROM CONTAINER -> 
CREATING CONTAINER FROM NEW IMAGE (THIS NEW CONTAINER IS COMPLETE PACK OF ALL THE APPLICATIONS THATS THE DOCKER WORKS)

*************   docker rm $(docker ps -a -q) - TO Remove all containers  ************
*************   docker stop $(docker ps -a -q) - To Stop all containers  *************
*************   docker start $(docker ps -a -q) - To Start all containers ***********
*************   dokcer image rm "image name" - to remove image (ex: docker image rm ubuntu - it will remove ubuntu image)



DOCKER FILE

A Dockerfile is a script with instructions on how to build a Docker image.
These instructions are, in fact, a group of commands executed automatically in the Docker environment to build a specific Docker image.



DOCKER COMPOSE

Docker Compose is software used for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. 
It can handle multiple containers simultaneously in the production, staging, development, testing, and CI environment. 
Therefore, use Docker Compose to manage the whole software development lifecycle (SDLC).
