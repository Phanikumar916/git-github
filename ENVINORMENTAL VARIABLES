MULTIPLE USERS IN LINUX ENVINORMENT
MULTI USER ENVINORMENT IS COMMON FOR ALL OPERATING SYSTEMS
Each User can Configure its own envinorment/account by setting preferences (Ex: you want GUI Layout, you want  Font to be bigger and Different Colour e.t.c)
These O.S Configurations should be isolated from other user envinorments

SO OPERATING SYSTEM STORES ALL THE INFORMATION IN ENVINORMENT VARIABLES

BASICALLY ENVINORMENT VARIABLES WERE DEIFNED BY KEY VALUE  PAIRS
In bash scripting we learnt about varaibles it is like (shell=/bin/bash - here shell is Variable name & /bin/bash is variable value)

But these ENVINORMENT VARIABLES are available for the whole envinorment not just for one specific script 
BY CONVENTION THE NAMES ARE DEFINED IN " UPPER CASE "

SHELL=/bin/bash - (Defualt shell programme (location) of the user)
HOME=/user/nana - Current Users home directory
USER=nana - Currently logged in user

Now we can change the shell programm like SHELL=/bin/zsh (The value of the Shell envinorment variable will point out the path of ZSH)
***** Varaibles are Variable, which means they can be chnaged ***********

********* printenv ********* to print out all the envinorement varaibles available


USE CASES OF ENVINORMENT VARIABLES

O.S Stores information about the envinorment
We can create our own envinorment variables

Ex: Let us say i want to run a Java Application on Linux Server with my user that Java Application needs to connect to Database
or externa API(Google Maps), Such External Services needs some kind of authentication and Application need some credentials

Now how can we tell the application in a Secure Way, what these secret values are like credintails for data base 
we cant write the User ID and Password values in the code of the application, Other people may see that and it is not secure.

Now how to store the data in the Secure Way, but also in a way that the application will access them when it Runs

How can we do these was setting data as ENV Variables on SERVER
ex: DB-PWD=secretpasswd
    DB_USER=mysqluser
So that apps can read the values of envinorment variables

Now how the application can read this ENV. Variables
Every Programing Language allows you to access envinorment variables

Creating ENV.Variables

export DB_USERNAME=dbuser
export DB_PASSWORD=secretpwdvalue
