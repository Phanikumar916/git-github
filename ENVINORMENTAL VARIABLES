MULTIPLE USERS IN LINUX ENVINORMENT
MULTI USER ENVINORMENT IS COMMON FOR ALL OPERATING SYSTEMS
Each User can Configure its own envinorment/account by setting preferences (Ex: you want GUI Layout, you want  Font to be bigger and Different Colour e.t.c)
These O.S Configurations should be isolated from other user envinorments

SO OPERATING SYSTEM STORES ALL THE INFORMATION IN ENVINORMENT VARIABLES

BASICALLY ENVINORMENT VARIABLES WERE DEIFNED BY KEY VALUE  PAIRS
In bash scripting we learnt about varaibles it is like (shell=/bin/bash - here shell is Variable name & /bin/bash is variable value)

But these ENVINORMENT VARIABLES are available for the whole envinorment not just for one specific script 
BY CONVENTION THE NAMES ARE DEFINED IN " UPPER CASE "

SHELL=/bin/bash - (Defualt shell programme (location) of the user)
HOME=/user/nana - Current Users home directory
USER=nana - Currently logged in user

Now we can change the shell programm like SHELL=/bin/zsh (The value of the Shell envinorment variable will point out the path of ZSH)
***** Varaibles are Variable, which means they can be chnaged ***********

********* printenv ********* to print out all the envinorement varaibles available
