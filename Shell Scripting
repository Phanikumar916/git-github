Suppose we add a Series of Commands in One Server
Now we want to Execute Same Commands in Multiple Servers (This is repetitive work right)
So we can Write the Commands in a file then we can execute a file 
File is Movable, So we can copy the file in another servers, we can share it with our teammates 

So bunch of Shell Commands is called " SHELL SCRPTING "
Shell Scripts have " .sh " file extension

WHAT IS SHELL
SHELL - THE PROGRAMME THAT INTERPRETS AND EXECUTES THE VARIOUS COMMANDS THAT WE TYPE IN THE TERMINAL
TRANSLATES OUR COMMAND THAT THE OS KERNEL CAN UNDERSTAND
IT IS THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THE USER AND THE KERNEL

DIFFERENT SHELL IMPLEMENTATIONS

sh (Bourne Shell)  - /bin/sh (Bourne Shell Programme Located in /bin/sh)
