Suppose we add a Series of Commands in One Server
Now we want to Execute Same Commands in Multiple Servers (This is repetitive work right)
So we can Write the Commands in a file then we can execute a file 
File is Movable, So we can copy the file in another servers, we can share it with our teammates 

So bunch of Shell Commands is called " SHELL SCRPTING "
Shell Scripts have " .sh " file extension

WHAT IS SHELL
SHELL - THE PROGRAMME THAT INTERPRETS AND EXECUTES THE VARIOUS COMMANDS THAT WE TYPE IN THE TERMINAL
TRANSLATES OUR COMMAND THAT THE OS KERNEL CAN UNDERSTAND
IT IS THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THE USER AND THE KERNEL

DIFFERENT SHELL IMPLEMENTATIONS

sh (Bourne Shell)  - /bin/sh (Bourne Shell Programme Located in /bin/sh)
used to be default shell programme for the UNIX like systems including Many older versions of LINUX systems
The name BOURNE SHELL coming from the author STEPHEN BOURNE

NEWER VESIONS OF LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS WE HAVE A SHELL PROGRAMME CALLED BASH
" BASH STANDS FOR -  BOURNE AGAIN SHELL "

 " BASH - /bin/bash "
 IMPROVED VERSION OF sh (BOURNE SHELL)
 Default shell programme for most UNIX like systems
 
 it is the best standard for UNIX Like systems
 
 Shell and Bash Terms are often used Interchangeable
 
 Bash is a Shell Programme
 Bash is a Programming Language
 
 
 
 *************** BASH SCRIPTING
 
 SHEBANG
 
 Now create a file (with .sh means it is a shell script file)
Ex: touch setup.sh

Now if we create no.of Shell Script Files, All the Shell Script files have the same Extension .sh file extension
so how does O.S know which shell to use and interpret and to process the script file
