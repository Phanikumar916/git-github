Jenkins is an open source automation tool written in Java programming language that allows continuous integration
Jenkins builds and tests our software projects which continuously making it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project, and making it easier for users to obtain a fresh build.
Plugin means small software to automate the process
It supports 1000 or more plugins to ease your work. If a plugin does not exist, you can write the script for it and share with community.
The main server of Jenkins is the Jenkins Master. It is a web dashboard which is nothing but powered from a war file. By default it runs on 8080 port.
JDK - Java Development (JDK) or Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
Master and Node will communicate through agent.jar
YUM - Package Manager in Linux
apt - ADVANCE PACKAGE TOOL in UBUNTU
During Creation of Ec2 Instacne - We have to select port no: 8080 (i.e during configure security group or we need to select all traffic)
Connect EC2 Instance
For checking which flavour we are using  - cat /etc/os-release
Go to https://www.jenkins.io/download/
Download the options provided in below table (Download Jenkins 2.346.2 LTS for:)
LTS means LONG TERM SUPPORT, for every 12 weeks they will update so bugs are less
Click on CENTOS/FEDORA/RED HAT
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
Jenkins.repo will be created, for checking type below command
cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
Type ll
then repository should be stable, type below command
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
Now Jenkins will be stabled
To start jenkins server we need to get requisites like GIT, MAVEN, if we need to run maven - JAVA is required
yum install git maven java-1.8.0-openjdk jenkins -y
sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -y
systemctl restart jenkins.service
systemctl status jenkins.service

In the Above commands first we have brough Repo, then installed Package and then Started service
First Time we will give star after installation or configuration files we will give restart

MASTER SLAVE CONCEPT
vim /etc/passwd
jenkins:x:995:993:Jenkins Automation Server:/var/lib/jenkins:/bin/bash (by defualt false will be there we need to change to bash)
as jenkins user need to login from bash
visudo
jenkins all=all nopasswd: all
passwd jenkins (give password)
we need to add jenkins to configuration files
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
password authentication yes (line no:63)
systemctl restart sshd
systemctl status sshd
if you want to connect with encryption to your server it is called SSH (SECURE SOCKET HOST)
D- DEAMON (BACKGROUND SERVICE)

IN NODES
useradd jenkins
passwd jenkins
visudo
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
systemctl restart sshd
systemctl status sshd

login to su - jenkins
we will login to bash user (because we have changed in vim /etc/passwd)
in real time we will login to default user bash, from that we will move to required user
sudo ssh-keygen
sudo ssh-copy-id jenkins@localhost (to connect to local host)
sudo ssh jenkins@localhost
exit (repeat for slave-1 & 2)
sudo ssh-copy-id jenkins@"private Ip"
sudo ssh jenkins@localhost (password for slave-1)
sudo scp secret.key jenkins@"private IP":/tmp (if we want to move to secret key to /tmp directory)


ls /usr/share/java (jenkins.war file will be located at this place)
copy Public ip and paste "public ip:8080"
then cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminpassword
Paste the password in text box
Click on Install Suggested Plugins
Create First Admin User
Click on Start using jenkins
Click on create New Job
Create Job-1 and click on build now
defualt it will store in "/var/lib/jenkins"
When Copying GIT Hub Link take Master branch
Select Git Hub Project available below description and in Source Code Management
then Paste Git Hub Link and then save 
when adding other then master Github link, type branch name in "Branches to build"

Build With Parameters

Select Build With Parameter
then Select Option File Parameter
then enter text and then save
then it will show "build with paramenters"
Click on Build with parameters
it will show upload your file
then build

CHOICE PARAMETER
Deployment in which server it needs to be done
Click on Choice parameter

BOOLEAN PARAMETER - YES OR NO
if it is always yes, select set by default option
then save and click and build with parameters and build

STRING PARAMETER
Servers Name we will not change in real time

MULTI-STRING PARAMETER
If we need to add N No.of Parameters we will use Multi String

GO TO ADVANCE OPTIONS
If we click on Disable Project, That project others will not see
In real time we will Create user id and password like for QA Team and we will give to that team
After they login they will see only the permissions given by us.

SheBang (#!)  - path directive for the execution of different kinds of Scripts like Bash, Python, etc.

In shell Scripting we need to give saces properly otherwise it will not execute

#!/bin/bash
touch file1
sleep=10
touch file2 (Simple execution)

UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM
One job is linked with another job
Go to post build actions for Job-1
Select Build other projects
and type Job-2
then go to dash board it will show as Downstream Job-2
After Job-1 build automaitcally Job-2 will be created
Similarly go to job-2 and go to post build options and type job-3
when Job-2 build, automatically job-3 will be created
For Job-2; Job-1 will be upstream and Job-3 will be the down stream
In real time for ex: When we will create jar file automatically War file should be created then this up and down streams will be used


SHEDULE PROJECTS

CRON GENERATION
Automatically build process, we will use cron
When Developer changes the code, it will automatically build for the given time period (like for evry hour e.t.c)
go to build triggers and select build periodically
* * * * * (5 stars)
MINUTE	Minutes within the hour (0–59) 
HOUR	The hour of the day (0–23)
DOM	The day of the month (1–31)
MONTH	The month (1–12)
DOW	The day of the week (0–7) where 0 and 7 are Sunday.
https://crontab-generator.org/ 

I doesnt require like this, when developer changes the code and pushes into git hub then only i need build
for this i will use
POLL SCM
Copy link from git hub
Select POLL SCM
then give * * * * * and then save
Intially 1st build will automatically generate
then modify some changes in main branch which you have copied url in Jeninks job
then save, then second build will automatically created based on changes
So whenever changes happended in Git Hub it will automatically triggered and build will happens
it will take time like 1 hr

WEBHOOKS
It will trigger when ever there will be changes in GITHUB within minutes
Go to Settings tab in Repository
Select WEBHOOKS (which is below the actions)
Select New Webhook then it will ask password
then in Payload URL copy and paste jenkins URL
http://ipaddress:8080/github-webhook/
then select Json format and then save
Create Job in jenkins
Copy Github URL link
and Select Github Trigger for SCM polling option in Built Triggers and then save
