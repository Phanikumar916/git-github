Jenkins is an open source automation tool written in Java programming language that allows continuous integration
Jenkins builds and tests our software projects which continuously making it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project, and making it easier for users to obtain a fresh build.
Plugin means small software to automate the process
It supports 1000 or more plugins to ease your work. If a plugin does not exist, you can write the script for it and share with community.
The main server of Jenkins is the Jenkins Master. It is a web dashboard which is nothing but powered from a war file. By default it runs on 8080 port.
JDK - Java Development (JDK) or Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
Master and Node will communicate through agent.jar
YUM - Package Manager in Linux
apt - ADVANCE PACKAGE TOOL in UBUNTU
During Creation of Ec2 Instacne - We have to select port no: 8080 (i.e during configure security group or we need to select all traffic)
