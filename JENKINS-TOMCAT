Go to Manage Jenkins - Click on Manage Nodes and Clouds
Click on New Node
Create a Node in Jenkins Webserver
Go to Global tool Configuration and go below there is maven, click on add maven and provide name and select version
Create a New Item by selecting Maven Project
Copy Git hub Webapp link which we have created pom.xml file
Type clean install package in Goals and options available in build tab
Then Save and Click on build
By defualt Deploy to a container option not availabe in post build actions
Go to Manage Jenkins - Manage Plugins - go to availble tab
Search Deploy - Click on Deploy to container and install
Next thing we need to set the credintials
Go to Dashboard  - Credintials - System - Global Credintials - Click on new credintials
Give Tomcat Credintials which we already installed in Node
If you want to deploy a war file through jenkins you should have role called manager - script
We have created user name: deployer and password: deployer in tomcat server give that credintials

Here two things i have done first one is deploy to a container and Setting Tomcat Credintials

Click on Post build actions
Select Deploy War/ear to a container
**/*.war - Type this one it indicates workspace root directory
Next Select Containers - Means in which application path we need to install - (Ex: We want to install on Tomcat - 8)
Select Tomcat - 8 Option
Tomcat Installed on Node Server here we have credintials, enter that credintials
Next We need to give tomcat url
Then apply and save
Then Click on save and then build
Then Go to Tomcat Instance
Go to /opt/apache-tomcat-8.5.81/webapps directory
Webapp file will be created
Go to webserver
http://3.88.137.78:8090/webapp/
Then You can see the content written in index.jsp file
IF somebody changes the code it should automatically triggers and build, the new build should be deployed into server (i.e tomcat server)
For that go to build triggers tab
and select POLL SCM Option
Give Shedule like */2 * * * * (Ex: for every two minutes it should check)
Then Jenkins Server will go and monitor GIT HUB repository
If any changes happened it will Trigger and Automatically build and it will display in Webapp ( http://3.88.137.78:8090/webapp/ )
In this i havent done any thing developers are developing the code due to CI/CD i can see the updates

IF WE WANT TO CHANGE IT FROM EC2 INSTANCE, WE NEED TO CLONE

git clone https://github.com/Phanikumar916/ValaxyTech-hello-world.git

go to directory where index.jsp file available

/root/ValaxyTech-hello-world/webapp/src/main/webapp

Edit the file using vi index.jsp

Now if you check git status, you can see one file has been modified

These one you need to commit into your git repository

git add . (you need to add to local repostitory that means in your machine)

Now if you see git status it will come into staged (i.e tracked) 

git commit -m "updated index file"

git push origin master
