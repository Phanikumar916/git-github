OPEN SOURCE INTERCONNECTION MODEL

IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH SUCCESSFUL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN COMPUTERS OR NETWORKS OR DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURES 7 LAYER OPEN SYSTEM
INTERCONNECTION MODEL INTRODUCED BY ISO IN 1984, EACH LAYER IS A PACKAGE OF PROTOCOLS

APLLICATION LAYER
IF I SAY APPLICATION LAYER IT DOESNOT MEAN THAT COMPUTER APPLICATIONS LIKE CHROME OR FIREFOX ETC BUT IT INCLUDES APPLICATION LAYER
PROTOCOLS LIKE HHTP & HTTPS THAT APPLICATIONS WORK CORRECTLY IN INTERNET

 FILE TRANSFER IS DONE BY USING FTP PROTOCOL
 WEB SURFING IS DONE USING HTTP/HTTPS PROTOCOL
 SMTP PROTOCOL FOR EMAILS
 TELENET FOR VIRTUAL TERMINALS
 APPLICATION LAYER PROVIDES SERVICES FOR NETWORKING APPLICAIONS WITH THE HELP OF PROTOCOLS TO PEROFORM USER ACTIVITIES
 
 
 PRESENTATION LAYER
 
 RECEIVES DATA FROM APPLICATION LAYER, THIS DATA IS IN THE FORM OF CHARACTERS AND NUMBERS
 THIS DATA WILL BE CONVERTED INTO BINARY LANGUAGE (THIS FUNCTION IS CALLED TRANSLATION)
 AND THEN IT WILL DO DATA COMPRESSION AS THE SIZE IS REDUCED IT WILL REACH THE DESTINATION IN VERY LESS TIME
 THEN AT SENDER SIDE DATA IS ENCRYPED AND AT RECEIVER SIDE DATA IS DECRYPED (SECURE SOCKET LAYER)
 
 
 SECESSION LAYER

 IT WILL HELP IN SETTING UP AND MANAGING CONNECTIONS, ENABLING SENDING AND RECEVING DATA, FOLLOWED BY TERMINATION OF CONNECTIONS AND
 SECESSIONS 
 
 SECESSION LAYERS HAS ITS OWN HELPERS LIKE API'S (APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE) LIKE EX: YOU HAVE TAKEN HELPERS FOR YOUR PARTY FOR CLEANING AND SERVING E.T.C
 
 NETBIOS(NETWORK BASIC INPUT AND OUTPUT SYSTEM) IS AN EXAMPLE OF API WHICH ALLOWS APPLICATIONS ON DIFFERENT COMUTERS TO COMMUNICATE EACH OTHER
 ONCE A CONNCETION IS ESTABLISHED WITH YOUR SERVER, A SERVER PERFORMS A FUNCTION  CALLED AUNTHETICATION, AUTHENTICATION IS A PROCESS OF 
 VERIFYING WHO YOU ARE, FOR THIS YOU WILL GIVE USER NAME AND PASSWORD, ONCE THE USERNAME AND PASSOWRD MATCHED, A CONNCETION IS 
 ESTABLISHED BETWEEN YOUR COMPUTER AND SERVER, AFTER AUTHENTICATION, AUTHORIZATION MEANS USED BY SERVER TO DETERMINE WHEATHER YOU HAVE
 PERMISSION TO ACCESS A FILE  
 BOTH AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION PERFORMED BY SECESSION LAYER
 SECESSION LAYER  KEEPS TRACK OF DOWINLOADING FILES WHICH WILL BE RECEIVED IN THE FORM OF DATA PACKETS, SECESSION LAYER KEEP A TRACK
 OF WHICH DATA PACKET BELONG TO WHICH FILE EITHER TEXT FILE OR IMAGE FILE AND TRACK AND WHERE THE RECEIVED DATA PACKETS WILL GO
 
 
 TRANSPORT LAYER
 
 CONTROLS RELIABILITY OF COMMUNICATION THROUGH SEGMENTATION, FLOW CONTROL & ERROR CONTROL
 
 SEGMENTATION: DATA RECEIVED FROM SECESSION LAYER IS DIVIDED INTO SMALL DATA UNITS CALLED SEGMENTS, EACH SEGMENT CONTAINS
SOURCE AND DESTINATION PORT NUM & SEQUENCE NO.
PORTNUMBER HELPS TO DIRECT EACH SEGMENT TO THE CORRECT APPLICATION & SEQUENCE NUMBER HEPLS TO REASSEMBLE THE SEGMENTS INTO CORRECT
ORDER TO FORM CORRECT MESSAGE AT THE RECEIVER 
FLOW CONTROL: MEANS THE AMOUNT OF DATA BEING TRANSMITTED 
ERROR CONTROL: IF DATA IS NOT RECEIVED IN DESTINATION TRANSPORT LAYER USES AUTOMATIC REPEAT REQUEST TO RETRANSMIT THE CORRUPTED DATA
A GROUP OF BITS CALLED CHECKSUM IS ADDED TO EACH SEGMENT BY THE TRANSPORT LAYER TO FINDOUT RECEIVED OR CORRUPTED SEGMENT 
PROTOCOL OF TRANSPORT LAYER:
                            1. TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL (TCP)  - CPNNECTION-ORIENTED TRANSMISSION SERVICE VIA DONE BY TCP
                            2. USER DATA GRAM PROTOCOL (UDP) - CONNECTION LESS TRANSMISSION SERVICE DONE VIA UDP
UDP IS FASTER THAN TCP BECAUSE IT DOESNOT PROVIDE ANY FEEDBACK WEATHER DATA RECEIVED OR NOT
TCP PROVIDES FEEDBACK, THEREFORE LOWEST DATA CAN BE RETRANSMITTED IN TCP
UDP EX:  ONLINE STEARMING MOVIES, SONGS, GAMES, ,TFTP , DNS E.T.C
TCP: WWW(WORLD WIDE WEB), EMAIL, FTP E.T.C 


NETWORK LAYER

TRANSPORT LAYER PASSES DATA SEGMENTS INTO NETWORK LAYER
WORKS FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF RECEIVED DATA SEGMENTS FROM ONE COMPUTER TO ANOTHER LOCATED IN DIFFERENT NETWORKS 
DATA UNITS IN THE NETWORK CALLED PACKETS
FUNCTIONS ARE: LOGICAL ADDRESSING, ROUTING & PATH DETERMINATION
LOGICAL ADDRESSING: IP ADRESSING IS BEING DONE LIKE IP4 & IP6
NETWORK LAYER ASSIGNS SENDER & RECEIVER IP ADDRESS TO EACH SEGMENT TO FORM AN IP PACKET 
ROUTING: MOVING DATA PACKET FROM SOURCE TO DESTINATION BASED ON LOGICAL ADDRESS OF MAT (IP4 & IP6 + MASK)
BASED ON IP DECISIONS AND MASK ROUTING DECESIONS ARE MADE IN COMPUTER NETWORK
EX: 255.255.255.0 (THIS MASK TELLS FIRST THREE COMBINATIONS REPRESNTS NETWORK AND LAST ONE REPRESENTS HOST OR COMPUTER B)
PATH DETERMINATION: CHOOSING THE BEST DELIVERY PATH FROM SOURCE TO DESTINATION IS CALLED PATH DERTERMINATION
(OPEN SHORTEST PATH FIRST - OSPF, BORDER GATEWAY PROTOCAL (BCP)  & INTERMEDIATE SYSTEM TO INTERMEDIATE SYSTEM (IS - IS )


DATA LINK LAYER

RECIVES DATA PACKET FROM NETWORK LAYER
DATA PACKETS CONTAIN IP ADDRESS OF SENDER AND RECEIVER 
TWO KINDS OF ADDRESSING: LOGICAL & PHYSICAL
LOGICAL ADDRESSING IS DONE IN NETWORK LAYER (WHERE SENDER AND RECEIVER IP ASSIGNED TO EACH SEGMENT TO FORM A PACKET)
 PHYSICAL ADDRESSING IS DONE IN DATA LINK LAYER WHERE MAC ADDRESS(MAC1 & MAC2) SENDER & RECEIVER ASSIGNED TO EACH DATA PACKET TO 
 FORM A DATA FRAME 
 MAC ADDRESS IS A 12 DIGIT ALPHA NUMERIC NUMBER EMBEDDED IN NETWORK INTERFACE CARD OF YOUR COMPUTER BY YOUR COMPUTER MANUFACTURER
 DATA FRAME PROVIDE MEANS TO TRASMIT DATA FROM ONE COMPUTER TO ANOTHER CVI
