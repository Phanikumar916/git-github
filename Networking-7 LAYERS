OPEN SOURCE INTERCONNECTION MODEL

IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH SUCCESSFUL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN COMPUTERS OR NETWORKS OR DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURES 7 LAYER OPEN SYSTEM
INTERCONNECTION MODEL INTRODUCED BY ISO IN 1984, EACH LAYER IS A PACKAGE OF PROTOCOLS

APLLICATION LAYER
IF I SAY APPLICATION LAYER IT DOESNOT MEAN THAT COMPUTER APPLICATIONS LIKE CHROME OR FIREFOX ETC BUT IT INCLUDES APPLICATION LAYER
PROTOCOLS LIKE HHTP & HTTPS THAT APPLICATIONS WORK CORRECTLY IN INTERNET

 FILE TRANSFER IS DONE BY USING FTP PROTOCOL
 WEB SURFING IS DONE USING HTTP/HTTPS PROTOCOL
 SMTP PROTOCOL FOR EMAILS
 TELENET FOR VIRTUAL TERMINALS
 APPLICATION LAYER PROVIDES SERVICES FOR NETWORKING APPLICAIONS WITH THE HELP OF PROTOCOLS TO PEROFORM USER ACTIVITIES
 
 
 PRESENTATION LAYER
 
 RECEIVES DATA FROM APPLICATION LAYER, THIS DATA IS IN THE FORM OF CHARACTERS AND NUMBERS
 THIS DATA WILL BE CONVERTED INTO BINARY LANGUAGE (THIS FUNCTION IS CALLED TRANSLATION)
 AND THEN IT WILL DO DATA COMPRESSION AS THE SIZE IS REDUCED IT WILL REACH THE DESTINATION IN VERY LESS TIME
 THEN AT SENDER SIDE DATA IS ENCRYPED AND AT RECEIVER SIDE DATA IS DECRYPED (SECURE SOCKET LAYER)
 
 
 SECESSION LAYER

 IT WILL HELP IN SETTING UP AND MANAGING CONNECTIONS, ENABLING SENDING AND RECEVING DATA, FOLLOWED BY TERMINATION OF CONNECTIONS AND
 SECESSIONS 
 
 SECESSION LAYERS HAS ITS OWN HELPERS LIKE API'S (APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE) LIKE EX: YOU HAVE TAKEN HELPERS FOR YOUR PARTY FOR CLEANING AND SERVING E.T.C
 
 NETBIOS(NETWORK BASIC INPUT AND OUTPUT SYSTEM) IS AN EXAMPLE OF API WHICH ALLOWS APPLICATIONS ON DIFFERENT COMUTERS TO COMMUNICATE EACH OTHER
 ONCE A CONNCETION IS ESTABLISHED WITH YOUR SERVER, A SERVER PERFORMS A FUNCTION  CALLED AUNTHETICATION, AUTHENTICATION IS A PROCESS OF 
 VERIFYING WHO YOU ARE, FOR THIS YOU WILL GIVE USER NAME AND PASSWORD, ONCE THE USERNAME AND PASSOWRD MATCHED, A CONNCETION IS 
 ESTABLISHED BETWEEN YOUR COMPUTER AND SERVER, AFTER AUTHENTICATION, AUTHORIZATION MEANS USED BY SERVER TO DETERMINE WHEATHER YOU HAVE
 PERMISSION TO ACCESS A FILE  
 BOTH AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION PERFORMED BY SECESSION LAYER
 SECESSION LAYER  KEEPS TRACK OF DOWINLOADING FILES WHICH WILL BE RECEIVED IN THE FORM OF DATA PACKETS, SECESSION LAYER KEEP A TRACK
 OF WHICH DATA PACKET BELONG TO WHICH FILE EITHER TEXT FILE OR IMAGE FILE AND TRACK AND WHERE THE RECEIVED DATA PACKETS WILL GO
 
 
 TRANSPORT LAYER
